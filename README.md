# project-onelife
The intent of this project is to expand my understanding of the Lua language and the Garry's Mod libraries, 
along with the end-goal of creating a gamemode which features specifically game types where players only receive one life.
These modes may be pulled from other games (Counter Strike, Insurgency, etc) and recreated in this gamemode, but the code will most 
likely be clunky, ineficient, and slow, as I'm still new to this.

For anyone other than myself reading this, feel free to help out if you'd like, but I reserve the right to ignore any pull requests.
This gamemode will soon hopefully be featured on egncommunity.com
