# project-onelife
The intent of this project is to expand my understanding of the Lua language and the Garry's Mod libraries, 
along with the end-goal of creating a gamemode which specifically features game types where players only receive one life.
These modes may be pulled from other games (Counter Strike, Insurgency, etc) and recreated in this gamemode, but the code will most 
likely be clunky, ineficient, and slow, as I'm still new to this.

For anyone other than myself reading this, feel free to help out if you'd like, but I reserve the right to ignore/deny any pull requests.

# Planned Game Features
 - 8 distinct classes each with a unique set of weapons and class progression
 - Weapons shop where players can buy new weapons and attachments for them (shop items and bought attachments are class-based, each class will have a different-looking shop selection)
 - Immersive combat audio dependent on the amount of players alive at the time
 - Utilization of Knife Kitty's INS2 weapon pack, a modified Customizable Weaponry 2.0 base
 - Teams, playermodels, and player dialogue ripped from MW2 multiplayer
 - 5 (planned) game types, all centered around players only getting 1 life
 - End-match accolades and awards based on game performance
 - Game stats saved across your career time (on a given server)
 - An end-match MVP screen where the top player performs a preselected taunt
 - A not-shitty UI (I hope)
