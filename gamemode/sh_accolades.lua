Comparitive accolades:
    Grim Reaper - Most kills
    Headhunter - Most headshots
    Necrotic - Most deaths
    The Benefactor - Most damage done (against enemies)
    The Malefactor - Most team-kills
    Pyromaniac - Most fire/explosive damage

    FaZe Candidate - Highest K/D ratio
    Haunted - Most afterlife kills (kills while dead)

Combat Achievements:
    Team Wipe - Kill the entire enemy team in one round (only applicable with 4+ enemies)
    5 kill streak - Kill 5 enemies without dying (does not count round end)
    10 kill streak - Kill 10 enemies without dying (does not count round end)
    Danger Close - Kill 3+ enemies with 1 explosion
    Collateral - Kill 2+ enemies with 1 bullet
    End-game (self-comparitive):
        Accident Prone - More suicides than deaths to enemies
        Optimist - More kills than deaths
        Girl Gamer - More assists than kills

The idea here:
    Because I'm entirely original, I thought it would be cool to create an end-game VIP screen, afterwhich the game distributes accolades to all of the players
    based on their performance, similar to games like Dirty Bomb, CoD, or Warface.
    The different accolade types you can receive:
        - Comparitive: how you played compared to everyone else who played (only 1 person a game receives these)
        - Combat: combat achievements earned for doing something noteworthy in that particular game (multiple people can receive these a game)
    The VIP screen is based purely on score.
